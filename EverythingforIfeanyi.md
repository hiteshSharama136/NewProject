Here's how you can set up everything for the CashFlex system in Azure, from scratch, including networking, services, and deployment resources. I'll break this into steps for infrastructure and services, along with recommendations for monitoring and CI/CD pipelines.

1. Create a Resource Group
Service: Azure Resource Groups
Purpose: Logical container for all resources (compute, networking, storage).

2. Create a Virtual Network (VNet)
Service: Azure Virtual Network (VNet)
Purpose: Network for communication between your application components.
Steps: Create subnets for AKS, App Services, etc.

3. Create Network Security Groups (NSG)
Service: Network Security Groups (NSG)
Purpose: Control inbound/outbound traffic for network interfaces.

4. Create Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster
Service: Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
Purpose: Container orchestration for running microservices (e.g., Transaction Management Service, Banking Service).
Steps: Create an AKS cluster and attach it to the VNet.

5. Create Azure App Configuration
Service: Azure App Configuration
Purpose: Central store for configuration settings.

6. Create Azure Key Vault
Service: Azure Key Vault
Purpose: Store secrets, credentials, and sensitive data securely.

7. Create Azure Cosmos DB or Azure SQL (for persistent data)
Service: Azure Cosmos DB / Azure SQL
Purpose: For storing user data, transaction data, and other critical metadata.

8. Create Azure Storage Accounts
Service: Azure Storage
Purpose: Storing logs, backups, or unstructured data.

9. Create Application Gateway (Optional)
Service: Azure Application Gateway
Purpose: Load balancing, web traffic routing for APIs.

10. Create Azure Functions (For Stateless Services like Transaction Execution)
Service: Azure Functions
Purpose: Serverless functions to run stateless transactions, notifications.

11. Create Azure Event Grid or Service Bus
Service: Azure Service Bus or Event Grid
Purpose: Messaging between components for real-time event-driven communication (e.g., Transaction Execution).

12. Create Azure Monitor & Log Analytics Workspace
Service: Azure Monitor & Log Analytics
Purpose: Centralized logging, monitoring for your infrastructure.

## Notes

1. Application Gateway: Placed in a public subnet to handle incoming traffic.
2. AKS and PostgreSQL: Placed in private subnets for security.
This setup ensures:

Proper subnet placement of all services (public/private).
Integration of Application Gateway with AKS.
SSL for HTTPS communication in production.
Secure PostgreSQL configuration.
Private Link communication between services.
